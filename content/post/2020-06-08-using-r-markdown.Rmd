this section is written in markdown. iT is used primarily not exclusively for discussion, explanation, etc.

```{r packageload, message=FALSE}
# load packages
library(tidyverse)
```

This would usually be about waffles, but instead I will do something boring with cars and the `mpg` data frame. Oh and I will also illustrate the use of inline R commends `r 1+6`

```{r picture}
#install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
pic <- ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```
This chunk has created the `pic` variable to draw the plot we just include the R command `print(pic)`

```{r plot}
print(pic)
```
